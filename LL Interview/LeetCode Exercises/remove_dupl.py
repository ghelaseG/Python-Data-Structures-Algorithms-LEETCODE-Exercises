"""
You are given a singly linked list that contains integer values, where some of these values may be duplicated.

Note: this linked list class does NOT have a tail which will make this method easier to implement.

Your task is to implement a method called remove_duplicates() within the LinkedList class that removes all duplicate values from the list.

Your method should not create a new list, but rather modify the existing list in-place, preserving the relative order of the nodes.

You can implement the remove_duplicates() method in two different ways:



Using a Set - This approach will have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. You are allowed to use the provided Set data structure in your implementation.

Without using a Set - This approach will have a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. You are not allowed to use any additional data structures for this implementation.
