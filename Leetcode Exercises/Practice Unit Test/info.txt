Unit tests play a valuable role in data science projects. 

They help ensure your code functions correctly on new datasets and can be easily shared with team members. 

Unit tests also help identify errors that might not be visible from charts alone. 

Incorporating unit tests lowers the chance of mistakes in your analysis, leading to more reliable decisions. 

Making unit testing a regular practice is essential.
