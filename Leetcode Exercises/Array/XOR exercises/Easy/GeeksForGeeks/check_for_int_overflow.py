"""
Write a “C” function, int addOvf(int* result, int a, int b) If there is no overflow, the function places the resultant = sum a+b in “result” and returns 0. Otherwise, it returns -1. The solution of casting to long and adding to find detecting the overflow is not allowed.
Method 1 
There can be overflow only if signs of two numbers are same, and sign of sum is opposite to the signs of numbers.
