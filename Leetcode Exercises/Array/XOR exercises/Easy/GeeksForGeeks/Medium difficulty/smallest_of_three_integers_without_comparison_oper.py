"""
Write a program to find the smallest of three integers, without using any of the comparison operators. 
Let 3 input numbers be x, y and z.
Method 1 (Repeated Subtraction) 
Take a counter variable c and initialize it with 0. In a loop, repeatedly subtract x, y and z by 1 and increment c. The number which becomes 0 first is the smallest. After the loop terminates, c will hold the minimum of 3.
