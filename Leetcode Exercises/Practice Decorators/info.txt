Python decorators are a way to modify a function or class's behavior without directly modifying its code. They allow you to wrap a function or class around another function, adding additional functionality before, after, or around the original function's execution. Decorators are denoted by the @ symbol followed by the name of the decorator function. They provide a concise and reusable way to extend Python code functionality. They are commonly used for logging, authentication, caching, and more.
